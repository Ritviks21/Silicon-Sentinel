## üìñ Project Overview

**Silicon Sentinel** is a state-of-the-art computer vision pipeline built to tackle one of the most critical challenges in the semiconductor industry: **automated defect detection**. By leveraging a fine-tuned **YOLOv8s** model on a robust, custom-generated synthetic dataset, this project provides a scalable and highly accurate solution for identifying microscopic flaws like scratches, particles, and blobs on silicon wafers, directly contributing to improved manufacturing yield and quality.

## üöÄ Our Journey: The Story of a Smarter Model

Every great project is a story of iteration. Our model wasn't built in a day; it was forged through a cycle of testing, failing, and improving. This journey showcases a real-world machine learning workflow.

<details>
<summary><strong>V1: The Naive Model - Our First Attempt</strong></summary>
<br>
We began by training a model on a simple dataset of basic scratches and particles. It worked perfectly on data it had seen before, but when shown a new defect type‚Äîa "blob"‚Äîit was completely blind.
<br><br>
üí° **Lesson Learned:** A model is only as good as the variety of its training data. Without variety, it cannot generalize.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>V2: The Overeager Model - A New Problem</strong></summary>
<br>
We rebuilt the dataset with more variety, including blobs. The model could now see all three defect types, but it became "trigger-happy," hallucinating defects on perfectly clean wafers.
<br><br>
üí° **Lesson Learned:** A model must be taught what a defect *is not*. Training on "negative" (clean) examples is critical to prevent false alarms.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>V3: The Ultimate Sentinel - The Final Iteration</strong></summary>
<br>
This was our final and most important iteration, where we addressed every lesson learned to build a truly robust AI.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Smarter Data:</strong> We generated our ultimate dataset with realistic textured backgrounds, curved/wavy scratches, and tiny isolated particles.</li>
  <li><strong>A Bigger Brain:</strong> We upgraded from the lightweight `YOLOv8n` to the more powerful `YOLOv8s` to better learn subtle patterns.</li>
</ul>
<br>
‚úÖ **The Result:** A reliable and intelligent model that correctly identifies a wide range of defects while correctly ignoring clean surfaces.
</details>

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **High-Fidelity Synthetic Data**: A custom data engine creates thousands of realistic training examples, including clean wafers, curved scratches, and varied particles.
- **Multi-Class Defect Recognition**: Accurately identifies and classifies 3 primary defect types: **scratch**, **particle**, and **blob**.
- **State-of-the-Art Accuracy**: Employs a fine-tuned YOLOv8s model with heavy data augmentation to achieve exceptional performance.
- **End-to-End & Reproducible**: A complete pipeline from data creation to model training, documented for easy replication.
